You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a
data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the
relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome).
They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
* "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
